
say for a region there are 10000 villages and 10000 buildings
under normal conditions, there should be 10000 complete records for villages
and 10000 complete records for buildings and 10000 areas on gaode map
and 10000 3d buildings on gaode map
The reality is that for villages, all gaode areas are provided
but only 8000 records are given (some have no bounds thus you must fill out in order to fix
such issue) and you have to draw manually to fix other 2000 records
For buildings, 7000 3d buildings are provided by gaode and for these
6000 records are given (some have no bounds thus you must fill out in order to fix such issue)
and you have to draw manually to fix other 1000 records
For other 3000 3d buildings you must render them yourself with special instructions
and draw manually to fix these 3000 records
Once these steps are taken, you should have 10000 villages on gaode map along with 10000
villages records and 10000 buildings on gaode map (some of which are done through special instructions)
along with 10000 buildings records 
With complete map renderings and records, you can now display these POIs normally
When you render a village, on top of area and record, use bounds to draw green polygon and turn it purple when under highlight
When you render a building, on top of 3d building and record, use lnglat to draw a blue marker and turn it red when under highlight

Current functionalities
1. Get gaode POIs data separately through Nodejs file
2. Create village/building
3. Highlight village/building
4. Highlight/Detail village/building
5. Highlight/Edit village/building
6. Highlight/Delete village/building
7. Filter villages through search terms or hasbuildings
8. Show/Hide bottom part
9. Compass

Possible functionalities (Currently removed)
1. Provice, city, county, has bounds filters
2. Satellite laer toggle
3. Show/Hide villages bounds
4. Show/Hide buildings names

LOGIC
For instance, there are 100 villages and 100 buildings for a region 
thus normally there should be 100 areas on map and 100 records for villages
and 100 3d buildings on map and 100 records for buildings
The reality:
For villages, all 100 areas are provided (checked). For records, gaode gives 70 (some of which have no bounds so you fix them) and 
you draw 30 through create village form so you end up with all 100 records. (checked)
For buildings, 70 3d buildings are provided and 30 are not. You fix these 30 3d buildings yourself(checked). For records, gaode gives 60 (some of 
which have no bounds so you fix them) and you draw 10 through create building form (mode #1) which match up 10 of 3d buildings that are alreay provided. You then
draw rest 30 through create building form (mode #2) which match up with buildings that are not on gaode map at all. You solve issue of not on map at same time. (checked)

Once these steps are taken, you have all 100 areas and 100 records for villages and 100 3d buildings and 100 records for building.
You can now display these POIs normally.
When you render a village, on top of area and record, use bounds to draw green polygon and turn it purple when under highlight
When you render a building, on top of 3d building and record, use lnglat to draw a blue marker and turn it red when under highlight

Logic
1. For every street, there should be a complete record and area on gaode map.
1. For every village, there should be a complete record and area on gaode map.
2. For every building, there should be a complete record and 3d building on gaode map.

by default, say user has 1000 streets, 1000 communities, 1000 villages, 1000 buildings
render them all on map (area and lightblue polygon, area and lightyellow polygon, area and lightgreen polygon, 3d building/object layer and blue marker)
and render 50 of each types on paginated tables (4 of them)
User may now highlight each item (say darkblue polygon, darkyellow polygon, darkgreen polygon, red marker), highlight/detail/edit/delete each item, create each item,
search each item
